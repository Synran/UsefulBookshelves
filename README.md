# Here! there is a nice thing for you, my bookshelves!

## a special container to store books
the bookshelves can store a little bit more than a normal chest
## each slot with unique 3d model and details
when you put a book in a slot you could notice a book model displayed in the bookshelves
## compatible with enchant table
just like the minecraft:bookshelf, my bookshelves did provide ability of enchanting

## can I store other mod's book in it?
yes,but you need add that book's key in my mod's config file
<br>
the key looks like "minecraft:stick",you could press "F3" + "H" in the game and hover your cursor in any items to get the key
# How to install
first, you download the latest version file. then just put it in your mods folder
# Future
